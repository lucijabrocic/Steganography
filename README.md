# Steganography
Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message,  image or video within another file, message, image or video. In this simple project the image steganography is implemented - a message is  encoded within the selected picture in a very simple way. This project is made using  HTML and JavaScript, so it contains two files corresponding to that. This was submited as one of the assignments for Programming paradigms course at my faculty, summer semester 2019.
